What is this and who is this for?</p><p class="mb12"> A. www.pcpricetracker.in is an Indian website which allows you to build PC config and share it with others. It allows copying Reddit markup.

It removes unnecessary information, shortens names, and optionally, removes the source. </p><p class="q">Q. Why should I use this?</p><p class="mb12"> A. You should use this if you want your build to be easily readable on your Reddit post.</p><p class="q">Q. What do I do if I encounter an error?</p><p>A. If you encounter an error, there are two possibilities. <ul class="mb12"><li>You have not pasted the full markup. To Solve, paste the full markup.</li><li>Something has changed with Reddit markup and this site has not been updated. Create a github issue.</li></ul></p><p class="q">Q.
